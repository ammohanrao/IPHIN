# IPHIN
Indian Public Health Intelligence Network

This is an open source software developed to keep track of disease outbreaks in India. Presently it's focus is to search several Indian online news papers including English and other languages like Telugu etc.

This project's aim is to extend the work of GPHIN (Global Public Health Intelligence Network):

As GPHIN work is limited to few global languages and does not cover any of Indian languages, we felt the need to fulfill this gap.

We wish to acknowledge our deep sense of respect for Dr.Larry Brilliant whose inspiration we take on this project:
